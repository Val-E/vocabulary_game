Game Rules:

Quiz:
You have to chose a category and a level.
In the first category you have to translate form German to English.
In the second you have to guess, which word fits the best way in.
And in the last you have to listen to a word and after listening, to spell it correct.
If you chose level one and answer is correct you get one point and your answer is wrong you lose one point.
The same way works level 2 and 3, except for the points. The points are corresponding to the level.

4 in a row:
Throw your balls from the top to the bottom.
Try to get four balls of your color in a horizontal, vertical or diaganol row to win.
